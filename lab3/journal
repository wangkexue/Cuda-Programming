Since the test use 1000 iterations, we need to do re-initializatin before each iteration,
instead of a cudaMemset, I initialize the global histogram in the kernel.

First Version: No shared memory, 2D blocks/ 2D grids. One point processed per thread.
Accelerated rate: 11.072 / 2.858 = 3.87.
    Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 1000 iterations) = 11.072
        Clock Time        (for 1000 iterations) = 11.06
    Timing 'ref_2dhisto' ended
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 1000 iterations) = 2.858
        Clock Time        (for 1000 iterations) = 2.85
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' ended

    Test PASSED
Second Version: No shared memory, 1D blocks/ 1D grids. Process point in stride way.
Accelerated rate: 11.2 / 2.52 = 4.44
Improvement than version 1: (4.44 - 3.87) / 3.87 = 14.7%.
Summary: no much improvement.
    Timing 'ref_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 1000 iterations) = 11.207
        Clock Time        (for 1000 iterations) = 11.19
    Timing 'ref_2dhisto' ended
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' started
        GetTimeOfDay Time (for 1000 iterations) = 2.52
        Clock Time        (for 1000 iterations) = 2.52
    Timing 'opt_2dhisto' ended
    Test PASSED
